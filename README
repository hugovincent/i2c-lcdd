I2C LCD Daemon for Newhaven I2C Character LCD Modules
Hugo Vincent, June 2009

This is a trivial interface for Newhaven LCD module connected to a Linux machine
over an I2C interface. Any standard Linux I2C bus should work (including USB I2C
adapters that correctly hook into the i2c kernel driver framework).

Opens a named pipe at /dev/lcd which can be written to by other applications.
Text written to this file will appear on the LCD. 
Send a bell ('\b')to clear the screen.

Tested with NHD-0420D3Z-FL-GBW (Digikey part number NHD-0420D3Z-FL-GBW-ND).

the manual for the LCD module.
